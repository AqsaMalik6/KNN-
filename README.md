# KNN-
Hey! 📚K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. 🧠 It classifies data points based on their proximity to other points in the training set. During prediction, it checks the 'k' closest points and assigns the most common class. Super easy to implement! 🚀👩‍💻
